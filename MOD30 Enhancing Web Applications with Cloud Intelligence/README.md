# MOD30 - Enhancing Web Applications with Cloud Intelligence

[![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-MOD-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite-learning-paths-training-mod/)

## Session Abstract

Tailwind Traders has implemented development frameworks, deployment strategies, and server infrastructure for their apps. But now that they are on the cloud itâ€™s time to extend functionality by tapping into powerful services that automatically scale and run exactly where and when they need them. This includes image resizing, messaging, integration with social media and tapping into cloud intelligence for image identification.

In this session, weâ€™ll create a set of routines that run on Azure Functions, respond to events in Azure Event Grid, and integrate cloud services with Azure Logic Apps. Weâ€™ll also use Azure Cognitive Services to add AI capabilities and Xamarin for a mobile app.

## How To Use

Welcome, Presenter!

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team.

Along with the video of the presentation, this document will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions &
code.

1. Read document in its entirety.
2. Watch the video presentation
3. Ask questions of the Lead Presenter

This training repository is divided in to the following sections:

| [Slides](#slides) | [Demos](#demos) | [Deployment](setup.md) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------
| 50 slides  | 5 demos  | 1 automated deployment

## Deployment / Preparation

>**What's Here?** Deploying the demo environment on Azure - including the prerequisites.

[Instructions and prerequisites are outlined here](setup.md).

### Demos
> What's Here? Pre-delivery preparation, stage ready videos, required files (such as JSON templates), and walk-through videos

Detailed explanations of each demonstration associated with this presentation can be found in this section. There are 3 "live from stage" technical demonstrations that utilize a number of tools both in and out of Azure. [You can get a high level overview of the tools and how we will be using them here](demos.md).
